                <p> ETIC Thematic Clouds is a resource aimed at gathering information, including texts, videos, and images.
                The word cloud is generated through the transcription of the 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP9pGhkLJlAXdXbzVvcl4snkAMkgTEjNH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviews</a>
                conducted by the new hires of the 
                <a href="https://www.einstein-telescope.it/et-in-italia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> ETIC (Einstein Telescope Infrastructure Consortium)</a>
                project. Users have the option to click on any word in the cloud, which will then be
                moved to a specific table. By pressing the "email" button, users can send additional material related to that word,
                providing a detailed description of the concept and their work. This material will be used to populate
                the contextual menu associated with each word in the cloud, further facilitating exploration and access
                to relevant information. The material will be used by the Communication Office to create new outreach and social media resources.
